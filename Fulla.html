            I used think that I wasn't fine enough<br>
            And I used to think I wasn't wild enough<br>
            But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out<br>
            Why you playin' games, what's this all about?<br>
        <p>
            And I can't believe you're hurting me<br>
            I met your girl what a difference<br>
            What you seen in her you ain't seen in me<br>
            But I guess it was all just make believe<br>
        <p>
            Oh love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found<br>
            Love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found, I found you<br>
        <p>
            Now you're goin',? What am I gonna do?<br>
            So empty my heart, my soul can't go on<br>
            Go on without you<br>
            My rainy days fade away<br>
            When you come around please tell me baby<br>
            Why you go so far away, why you go<br>
        <p>
            Love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found<br>
            Love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found, I found you<br>
            Who would have known I'd find you?<br>
        <p>
            Now you're goin',? What am I gonna do?<br>
            So empty my heart, my soul can't go on<br>
            Go on baby without you<br>
            Rainy days fade away<br>
            When you come around say you're here to stay with me boy<br>
            I don't want you to leave me, I, I need you<br>
        <p>
            Love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found<br>
            Love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found<br>
            Love, never knew what I was missin'<br>
            But I knew once we start kissin' I found<br></center></p>
